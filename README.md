# webapp-falling

{note to self: make sure to add a full tech stack explaining how you built your project}

What can I make in this?
-  A game where a person is falling down between a cavern, and the user has to somehow help them hold on for dear life? something like that game where the guy was in a pot and used a sledge hammer to move up (sounds very generic)
- Pumpkin carver: basically the user has to carve a pumpkin, add a export functionality so that they can share whatever abominations they'll probably make
- CEO Downfall simulator: the user is a ceo, and they gotta make sure that they get a downfall, even though their luck is insanely good
- Card stacking thingy: gotta stack the cards, in a tower like format
- Fireworks: the user is a firework rocket, they gotta maneouver themselves to avoid peeps standing on the ground, the rocket is technically falling?

option I'ma go for:
user gotta make a rocket with the correct amount of powder and stuff and launch it at a specific angle, the farther they go the better

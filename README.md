## A bit about this game

Basically, the user will be a rocket maker. They gotta make a firework rocket with the perfect combination of powder and size and such. The farther/higher up they go the more points they get. Will need to add a scoreboard or something

## Things I wanna have:
- Rocket firework physics
    - Will probably have to use an external library for this
- degree calulator, to measure at what degree the user is pushing the rocket off at
- Some kinda way to measure what would be a good mix of nitroglycerin or gunpowder and such, can't make it too boring now can we?
- Scoreboard
- 3 trillion billion ice cream chips worth of bottles

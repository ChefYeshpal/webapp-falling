## A bit about this game

Basically, the user will be the ISS controller, they gotta control stuff on the ISS. Will need to make a branching tree or something for choices and all. I'll make it up as we go

## Things I wanna have:

* Add a slow rotating background, so that it looks a little bit more realistic?
* maybe add a sun too or moon, moonfall!!!!
* 3 trillion billion ice cream chips worth of bottles

## Devlogs

* 21 Oct 2025
     Updated the base files and added an external library
    * Created camera and set up the basic scene for the ISS and earth view
    * Used NASA image of earth as wrapper
    * ISS is just a blob for now
* 22 Oct 2025
    * Created a little more detailed ISS, not a blob anymore
        * Has solar panels and different modules (2)
        * Will probably change it if needed in the future
    * ISS will slowly fall downwards, and burn up in the atmosphere
    * Added a "ring" like atmosphere, will search up how to have it be a gradient or something instead considering it looks rather un-natural

## A bit about this game

Basically, the user will be a rocket maker. They gotta make a firework rocket with the perfect combination of powder and size and such. The farther/higher up they go the more points they get. Will need to add a scoreboard or something

## Things I wanna have:
- update this tmrow
- Add a slow rotating background, so that it looks a little bit more realistic?
- maybe add a sun too or something
- 3 trillion billion ice cream chips worth of bottles
